      Similarity threshold score to filter the search response by. Only documents with similarity
      score equal or greater than the 'threshold' will be returned. Note that this is a post-processing
      step performed on the client not the server side. A threshold value of 0.0 means any similarity
      is accepted or disable the similarity threshold filtering. A threshold value of 1.0 means an exact
      match is required.
